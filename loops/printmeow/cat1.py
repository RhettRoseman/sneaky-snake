#print("meow" * 3)
    # prints meowmeowmeow
    # not what we want 

# print meow with a new line --- \n means new line

#print("meow\n" * 3)
# prints meow 1 time 


print("meow\n" * 3, end = "")
# expected export : 
    # meow
    # meow
    # meow

# for loop may be a better to do if you want to print something multiple times
