# Another way to write a while loop 
# in computer science we start counting from 0
# declare the variable i
i = 1
# while i is less than  3 print meow
# if you did the <= operator then you would have meow 4 times

while i < 3:
    print("meow")
    # start from 0 and increment by 1 till we get to 3
    i = i + 1

    # expected export meow meow meow
